# reshadefx-code-snippets

This repository aims to simplify the development of shaders for [ReShade](https://reshade.me/) by adding [ReShade FX](https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders/blob/master/REFERENCE.md)-specific [code snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Installation
Copy ``hlsl.json`` into ``%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets``
